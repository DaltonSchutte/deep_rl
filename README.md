# Deep Reinforcement Learning
Collection of my DRL projects

### Currently Completed:

Temporal Difference Methods/td_lambda

Various Warm Ups (Not necessarily 'deep' methods)

### To Be Trained:

None

### In Progress:

Double DQN (Breakout)

  -Training on GPU revealed that the model was not converging and thus the agent was not learning. Redesign in progress.
